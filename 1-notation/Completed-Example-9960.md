## Get the code solution

Click on this [directory copy link](cmd cp -r /home/codio/workspace/.guides/solution /home/codio/workspace) to get the completed version of the code for this activity.

This serves 2 purposes:

1. You will likely want to use the functions in binary_convert.c/h in other situations during the first part of this course. It is useful to see examples of this in hex.c and test.c.

2. You can look at the main function in **test.c** to see how we documented each test case and followed the rules of thumb to create them. We will be asking you to do the same for your homework in the future.

To try out this version, you can do this on the command line of the terminal:

    cd solution

Then you will be in the solution directory. You can then use make to compile this version.

To get back out of the solution directory, you can do the following:

    cd ..

We will not always provide solutions for every activity. We will do it here at the beginning so that you can have a reference example for thorough testing.
